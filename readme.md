This repo is my journey to learn typescript. 

You can find the implementation of many typescript concepts in their related files inside this repo. 
To initialize the repo just use "npm i" in the terminal.
To run a file, navigate to src folder and then type "npx ts-node 'Filename.ts'". 

If you encounter and error related to typescript not being installed, use this article and follow the steps for installation and setup -> https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/typescript-running-typescript-ts-node

Happy learning!
